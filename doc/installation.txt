=============================
deploy-commander installation
=============================

Deploy commander is easy to install and configure. Here we'll explain the basic installation.

If you're completely new to python,pip and or virtualenv please follow the :doc:`tutials <tuturials>` 

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 2.7

Other libraries will be installed by the pip installer:

- pycrypto==2.6.1
- ecdsa
- jinja2 
- fabric==1.10.0
- simple-crypt



Best practices
--------------

- In production encrypt the config files.
- On unix based machines make sure the user directory (best to use deploy user) is encrypted/secured
- Make sure if you make a backup of copy on your dev, that it's secured.
- For production use a dedicated deployment environment.
- Use virtualenv

Install deploy commander
------------------------

::

	$ sudo pip install deploy-commander
	
This will install the python libraries.
It's better to use virtualenv, but this is something we don't explain here.

Once installed, take a look at our :doc:`tuturials <tuturials>`, :doc:`key concepts <key-concepts>` and :doc:`general usage <usage>`


Example deployment configuration
--------------------------------

We have a github example repo available with all the examples from the tuturials `deploy-commander-example <https://github.com/munstermedia/deploy-commander-example>`_
