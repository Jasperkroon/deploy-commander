deploy-commander installation
=============================

Deploy commander is easy to install and configure. Here we'll explain the basic installation.

If you're completely new to python, pip and or virtualenv please follow the :doc:`tuturials <tuturials>` 

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 2.7

(others not tested yet)

Other libraries will be installed by the pip installer:

-	pycrypto==2.6.1
-	ecdsa
-	jinja2 
-	fabric==1.10.0
-	simple-crypt==4.0.0
-	cython==0.22

Best practices
--------------

- In production encrypt the config files.
- Make sure the user home directory (best to use deploy user) is encrypted/secured
- Make sure if you make a backup of copy on your dev, that it's encrypted.
- For production use a dedicated deployment environment.
- Use virtualenv

If you want to integrate with bitbucket, github or other systems you'll need start this server.
