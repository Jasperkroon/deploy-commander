Actions
=======

Actions/Commands can best be defined as an isolated predefined functions.
We're continuessly developing on these commands to give you as much features.

- sequence : Numeric value in which order the commands will be executed
- execute : Main command to execute <package>.<action>
- params : Set of key/values for the command
- confirm (optional) : Asks if you want to execute this command.. you can enter an own question as it's value
- description (optional) : Can be used to describe the command

You can use generic params in the command params to prevent repetition.
So if you define a key/value in the 'main' params you can use this like '%(param)s'
