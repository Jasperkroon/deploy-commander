What is deploy commander?
=========================

A command line tool for unix based OS mainly used for remotely executing sysadmin tasks.
As the name might give you a clue... it's power lies with managing deployments/software builds for continuous integration flows.

Deploy commander is build directly on python/fabric, but can be used for any project.

Main goal of this application is to configure your deployment by using a generic set of predefined actions.

There are other flavors for setting up your dtap... we're focussing on simplicity and transparancy
 in a centralized application to manage `different deployments` (applications) for `multiple apps` build in `different languages` on `different servers`.

We're building a lot if handy features for sysadmins and developers that will make your life easier. 

Stuff like:

- Git checkout and update
- Create/ensure folders dynamicly
- Backup database on deployment
- Import database
- Download files (like assets) for backup.
- Upload files (like assets) for preperation
- Upload templates for dynamic settings

.. NOTE::
	This application is still in it's development phase.

Continuous integration
----------------------

We're still in beta mode, but soon you'll be able to attach github and bitbucket hooks to automate the deployment process


What it's not!
---------------

- Puppet, (can be used for setting up server software but verry handy in your project!)
- Chef (See Puppet)
- Sys ops server management (See puppet/Chef)
- Jenkins (CI Server, we might build an equivelent :))
- Capistrano (Allso used for deployments... but mostly used per project/site...)

Cases
-----

- You would like to setup a project on different ubuntu machines.
- Download assets from server x, and upload them to server y.
- Deploy a new version of your app to a server, and backup the database before running migrations
- More...

Main goals
----------

- Centralized deployment
- Ease of deployments
- Ease of sysadmin tasks
- Simplified deployment by simple configurations
- Unix based environments
- Continuous integration
