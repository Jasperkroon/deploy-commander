Usage
=====

Usage is very simple, by executing a command from the terminal you can initiate `tasks`

If this is the first time you're using this, you might want to start with a :doc:`tuturial <tuturials>` and understand the :doc:`key concepts <key-concepts>`.

Command line execute
--------------------

There are 2 options when executing a `deploy-command` from the command line.

::

	$ deploy-commander go run:<task>
	
The `go` part will ask you for the project and environment you want to use.
The `run` part will execute several actions (`Like git clone, mysql import`) combined. We defined this as `the task`.

You can bypass the prompt for the project and environment by setting them in your command.

::
	
	$ deploy-commander go:<project>,<enviroment> run:<task>
