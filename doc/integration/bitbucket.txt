Bitbucket integration
=====================

It's possible to connect bitbucket to deploy-commander and automate some deployment tasks.

Bitbucket pull request post hook
--------------------------------

Bitbucket has a post pull request hook that will post information about a pull request to a url.
We have exposed a rest endpoint that can catch this post request.

Be sure that you have the deploy-commander webserver running! 

.. note:: Still in beta now.. we'll update as much as possible.


Bitbucket hook
--------------

Go to your webadmin https://bitbucket.org repo. Under settings -> hooks you'll find 
hooks. 

Select the `Pull Request POST` and enter your deploy-commander rest endpoint:
