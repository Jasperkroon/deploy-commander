So we've finally created a version that works and our documentation is getting better. 
I was thinking `now` is the time to start with a historical news log. 

In the current release (0.1.3) we've integrated a rest webserver to handle task request and 
integrate a bitbucket hook to automate the deployment proces.

We think the rest api will be the entry point to communicate with deploy-commander. 
We're thinking about developing a web interface that 'talks' to your deploy-commander instance. 
Maybe a iphone/android app to track deployments would be a nice addition! 

So in the next releases we might move certain command line actions to the rest api.
Expect more functionality in the upcoming months!
